# SQL-DP

This repository contains the implementations for difficulty prediction task for Structured Query Language (SQL) programming problems.

The main objective of the project is to predict the difficulty of each given SQL programming problem based on its stem and answer (i.e., SQL code).

# SQL-DP Framework

In SQL-DP, semantic features of problem stems and structure features of problem answers in the form of SQL codes are both computed at first, using the NLP and the neural network techniques. Then, these features are used as the input to train a difficulty prediction model with the statistic error rates in tests as the training labels, where the whole modeling do not introduce any experts, some as knowledge labeling. Finally, with the trained model, we can automatic predict the difficulty of each SQL programming problem.
